# SuccessHers: Empowering Women for Career Growth in India

## Problem Statement

In India, despite the growing need for gender-inclusive workforces, millions of women face barriers in accessing personalized skill development, affordable learning resources, and job opportunities aligned with their strengths. Many platforms provide either learning or job listings, but few offer an integrated experience that assesses individual skills, guides women on tailored upskilling paths, and connects them to meaningful employment. This gap leads to untapped talent, lower female workforce participation, and missed economic potential. There is an urgent need for a solution that mentors, supports, and empowers women through every stage of their career journey — from self-discovery to securing the right job.

## Project Overview

**SuccessHers** is an AI-driven platform designed to empower women in India by providing an end-to-end solution for career growth. The platform acts as a digital mentor and companion, supporting women at every stage of their professional journey.

### Key Features

- **Skill & Interest Assessment:** Interactive questionnaire to evaluate users' current skills, interests, and career goals.
- **Personalized Upskilling Paths:** AI-powered recommendations for curated courses and learning resources tailored to each user's profile.
- **Job Matching:** Connects users to relevant job opportunities through platforms like LinkedIn and others, based on their skills and aspirations.
- **Progress Dashboard:** Real-time tracking of learning and job application progress, with engaging visuals and motivational insights.
- **Mentorship & Support:** Guidance, encouragement, and resources to help women overcome barriers and achieve their career goals.

## How It Works

1. **Onboarding & Assessment:** Users complete a detailed questionnaire about their background, skills, interests, and goals.
2. **Personalized Recommendations:** The platform analyzes responses and suggests upskilling paths, including online courses and resources.
